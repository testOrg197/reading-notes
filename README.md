### *Class 01 Reading*

#### Pain vs. Suffering

- Pain of growth is different than suffering
- One way to combat - keep your eye on the prize
- Ask questions, seek answers, and find a remedy

#### Beginner's guide to Big O Notations

- O(1): An algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
- O(N): Algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set
- O(N2): Performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
- O(2N): Growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. (One of the worst case scenarios)

### *Class 02 Reading*

#### In Tests We Trust â€” TDD with Python

- Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think tests-first.
- Tests can be considered as your living documentation, name of test should self-explain
- Test file name should follow the same name of module name
- AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert
- *Arrange* organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
- *Act* execute the code being tested (exercise the behavior)
- *Assert* check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting
- Write the test (fail), write the feature (pass), refactor

#### Recursion

- What is recursion (besides my worst nightmare?!)?
- The process in which a function calls itself is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
- Difference between direct and indirect recursion: 
- *Direct* Calls function directly
- *Indirect* Calls function through another function
- *Tail Recursion* is when that function is the last thing to be called
